# Behold! The Dungeonator!
## -inator!
"Dungeon of Doom" from Richard D. Clark's "Let's Build a Roguelike" made in Ruby
## About
Trying to improve my skills on Ruby, I decided to do something both fun and challenging - a Roguelike that is - and Clarks's book is used for tutorial and reference purposes. And yes, the book shows how to do a roguelike in **Basic, not Ruby**.
## Status
This project is in it's early stages, I'm figuring out how to do in Ruby things, that are easy in Basic - graphics is great example, as I spent about two weeks trying different gems under different OSes. So everything is a subject to change. Although I'm sticking with SDL on graphics.
## TODO - long-term
* Figure out a way to ship

  _Ruby is great for two things: graphics and shipping. Irony intended._
* Write my own wrapper for SDL2

 _Current SDL wrapper is [Ruby/SDL](https://github.com/ohai/rubysdl), but all and any SDL wrappers for Ruby are long abandoned by their authors, and none of them are updated for SDL2. I don't need all of SDL's functions, so I could write a small wrapper for only those of them, which this project reqires._
* Update to tiles

  _Although there is no need, it shouldn't be that hard, and I'm already offered artist services._
* Finish it

  _It's going to be really hard to fulfill any other TODOs, if I'll fail this one._

## Collaboration & stuff
I want to finish this project on my own, even if it's gonna take years. But feel free to fork and judge or whatever.

## What's with this '-inator' thing?
Technically roguelike dungeon crawler has nothing to do with cartoon evil scientists, I just want to pay tributes to things and characters I like. This in particular is a reference to dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz.
